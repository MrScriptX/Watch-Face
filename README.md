# Watch Face

This repository will compiled resources for making Watch Faces as Google seems like they don't care about it. Feel free to sumbit resources too. Be it scripts or tutorials.

## Watch Faces Format

The new watch face format is a simpler way to build Watch Faces based on a XML file. This is a no code option that is less powerful but supposedly more power efficient.

The resources for this are found in the [WatchFaceFormat folder](/WatchFaceFormat/README.md)
