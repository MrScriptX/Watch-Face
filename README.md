# Watch Face

Welcome to my repository for Watch Face development on Wear OS! Tired of feeling abandoned by Google's lack of support, I created this repo to share scripts and tutorials that I found or wrote myself. I hope it'll help.

## Watch Faces Format

The Watch Face Format is a no-code solution for designing Watch Faces on Wear OS devices, using XML files to define visual and interactive elements. It simplifies the development process, but it is less powerful than the traditional Jetpack API approach.

The resources for this are found in the [WatchFaceFormat folder](/WatchFaceFormat/README.md)

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged and welcomed, especially considering that Google seems to have taken a vacation when it comes to supporting developers. Whether you're trying to fill the void left by Google's negligence or simply want to share your expertise, your contributions can make a significant difference.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

1. **Submit Tutorials**: Since Google hasn't bothered to provide adequate guidance, we rely on each other to figure things out. If you've stumbled upon or created tutorials related to Watch Face development for Wear OS, please share them. Let's show Google how it's done.

2. **Provide Resources**: Design assets, code snippets, documentation—anything that makes Watch Face creation easier is a valuable addition. Since Google seems to be too busy lounging around, it's up to us to gather the resources we need.

3. **Offer Feedback**: If you've been banging your head against the wall trying to make sense of Google's sparse documentation (or lack thereof), share your frustrations and suggestions for improvement. Maybe, just maybe, someone will listen.

4. **Bug Fixes and Enhancements**: If you come across any issues or bugs in existing resources, or if you have ideas for enhancing them, feel free to submit pull requests with your fixes or improvements.

To contribute, simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Your contributions will be reviewed and appreciated—unlike our requests for help from Google.
